## **Global Dictionary** 

Global Dictionary is a free digital dictionary for advanced learners of the English language. It has been created to provide millions of English definitions, spellings, audio pronunciations, example sentences, contextual usages, and relevant images all for free. It is an API-based dictionary powered by some of the best-known APIs available on the Internet. We have made sure that all these APIs work smoothly together to give our users an excellent experience while using the dictionary. It is a fully responsive web application working perfectly on all common screen sizes.

Users of the website are not required to sign up to use the dictionary and have access to all the information they need regarding the words or phrases they look up. However, logged in users have the convenience of having their search history saved automatically. This is actually a very great feature for English language learners because as our users they will be freed up of the need to have their vocabulary notebooks with them all the time. 

Once a word or phrase has been added to a userâ€™s personal notebook, they have access to it forever inside their own profile. Our users can easily move vocabulary in their personal notebook, remove words or phrases that are no longer needed, and even take unlimited personalized vocabulary tests based on their own search history. They can also easily show or hide definitions to learn new vocabulary the way they prefer. By using AJAX calls, we have made sure that these operations are handled smoothly. 

It should be noted that all due diligence is taken to make sure the personal information of our users is stored safely in our database. We have used hashing and salting algorithms for storing user passwords to make sure that our users and their passwords are safe even if our database is breached for any reason out of our control.
